# Introduction

laminas-paginator is a flexible component for paginating collections of data and
presenting that data to users.

The primary design goals of laminas-paginator are as follows:

- Paginate arbitrary data, not just relational databases.
- Fetch only the results that need to be displayed.
- Do not force users to adhere to only one way of displaying data or rendering
  pagination controls.
- Loosely couple to other Laminas components so that users who wish to
  use it independently of laminas-view, laminas-cache, etc. can do so.
